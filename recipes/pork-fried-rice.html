        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 small yellow onion</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>8 ounces ground pork</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups cold cooked white or brown rice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the small yellow onion.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a wok or large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add 2 large eggs and gently scramble with a rubber spatula until just softly set, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl or plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the onion, 8 ounces ground pork, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper to the pan. Cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon into small pieces, until the pork is cooked through and the onion is tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and let heat for a few seconds. Add 2 cups cold cooked rice, 1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots, and 2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari, and stir-fry until the rice is heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Return the eggs to the pan. Remove from the heat and stir in 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil.</li>
        </ol>
