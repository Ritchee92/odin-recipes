        <h3>A big chewy delicious chocoalte chip cookie</h3>
        <p>Here is an amazing recipe to make some sweet and rich delicious chocolate chip cookies. This recipe was made by Alvin Zhou. Here is a link to the <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/the-best-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies">article.</a></p>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>4 ounces milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks</li>
            <li>4 ounces dark chocolate chunk, or your preference</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your hard work. This recipe will make around 12 cookies.</li>
