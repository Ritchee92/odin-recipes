        <p>A great recipe to make some juicy and delicious cheeseburgers pulled from the web. The credit goes to Natasha Kravchuk for writing the recipe. Here is a link to the <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/perfect-burger-recipe/">article.</a></p>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces ground chuck beef, (80/20)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Pickle</li>
            <li>Bacon</li>
            <li>Burger buns</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice, and prepare all of your burger toppings and sauces.</li>
            <li>Spread the cut-side of the bun with softened or melted butter and toast the cut side on a skillet or on the grill until golden brown. You can toast the bun ahead or in the last couple of minutes with the burgers on the grill. Toasting the bun adds great flavor and prevents a soggy bun.</li>
            <li>Preheat grill to medium heat. Form patties that are about 1/2" thick and 1" wider than the burger buns. Season patties generously with salt and pepper or any desired seasonings. </li>
            <li>Grill hamburger patties (indent-side-up) covered for 3-5 min each side on the grill. Flip burgers when juices are accumulating on top of the burger and you have a good sear. Apply cheese in the last 1-2 minutes of grilling then cover with the lid and cook until the internal temperature of beef reaches 160ËšF</li>
            <li>Cook bacon (if you decide to add)</li>
            <li>Add desired extras such as tomato, lettuce, anything you like</li>
        </ol>
